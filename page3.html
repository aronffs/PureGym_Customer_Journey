          <p>A sponsored post from PureGym pops up: "Meet Zara from Shoreditch — she joined PureGym last year and found her 6AM motivation." (He thinks: "At least they're not using fake models for once. If it's not too crowded, I might actually go after work.")</p>

Inside, a mini five-minute workout circuit plays on loop, glowing floor tiles tracking each rep. Outside, a counter reads: "Total reps done by London today: 3,127."</p>

Staff in branded hard hats guide passersby through quick workouts, flipping tires, pulling ropes, and stacking sandbags. It's half building site, half workout zone, chaotic, funny, and full of energy. Jordan joins in for a laugh… and ends up breaking a real sweat.</p>
