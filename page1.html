          <h3>Instagram Feed</h3>
          <p>PureGym's logo flashes across her Instagram feed, a short motivational clip she's seen a dozen times before. (She thinks: "Yep, same ad, same slogan. But I've been with them long enough, they don't need to sell me again.")</p>

          <h3>Walking Past Her Local Branch</h3>
          <p>On her way to work, she walks past her local branch, a familiar sight. The posters outside promote no contract, low cost, open 24/7, the same reasons she joined years ago. PureGym isn't shouting for her attention anymore. It's simply part of her routine, like her morning coffee.</p>
