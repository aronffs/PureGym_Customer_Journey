          <p>A sponsored post flashes up: "NO JOINING FEE — This Week Only 💥" (Smiling, he thinks: "Perfect timing. I've been saying I'll get back into the gym forever.") He taps through, lands on PureGym's page, and sees similar ads across his feed.</p>

          <h3>Friend's Recommendation</h3>
          <p>Later that day, a friend mentions they joined last month because of the half-price first month offer. The deal feels too good to miss, cheap, easy, and nearby.</p>

      <div class="timeline-event left">
        <div class="content">
          <h3>The Packed Gym Experience</h3>
          <p>When he does go, the gym's packed. Every cable machine taken, dumbbells scattered everywhere. He spends more time waiting than lifting. The air feels stuffy, the Wi-Fi cuts out mid-song, and the vending machine swallows his £2 coin.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="timeline-event right">
